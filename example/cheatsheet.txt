# A cheatsheet which illustrate ahrf syntax

:: Here we go! ::

I was walking on the road and I saw a wonderful grove[1]. So, I decided to
visit it because the light was unbelievable and unreal. There was some sun
rays through trees. I was just speechless.

But something bad happened: I heard a plane in the sky and it was doing a
loud noise. All the animals were scared. There were a bear, wild boars and
foxes. Before I was able to hide behing a huge rock, the plane started to
go down. I wondered why... Maybe he wants to attack me? I looked in the
clouds and it was flooded by flying papers. By the way, the plane's name
was "POODLE"[2]. Don't know what it means.

For every sheets, it was an OpenSSL CVE[3]. I could barely see more than a
thousand documents. Since then, I'm very worried when I hear a plane. I
hope you understand why now.

Here an example:

====
And static libraries and linker config files:
 
tar xzpf comp.tgz \*libssl\* \*libcrypto\*
 
Since the vulnerability is in a shared library, getting the old
library purged and the fixed one into use requires restarting
all programs that load libssl and libcrypto.
The easiest way to do this is to reboot the system.
Another method: using /bin/sh,
ps ax -o pid | (while read pid; do \
	pmap $pid | egrep '(libssl|libcrypto)' && echo found $pid ; done)

CVE-2014-3508: 6th August 2014

::: What to do? :::

First, you need to calm down. Don't be worry about it because it's
unproductive. Try to find a better alternative[4].

:::: Step 4 ::::

* Get a knife
* Cut the packaging
* Prepare the stove
* Do a garlic sauce with butter[5]

# Lurker comment

::::: Is that over?

** Find a spoon
*** Dip it in the Olive oil
**** Make sure it's not boiling
***** Taste it! [6]

:: Notes

Instead of reading the file, you should try and test the script itself. You
are losing time by procrastinating like that.
